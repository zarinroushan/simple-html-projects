# Simple HTML Projects
A collection of my beginner-level HTML practice projects.

## Projects

### 1. Missing Pet Alert Page
A basic HTML webpage that simulates a missing pet notice. Includes details like age, breed, contact info, and links using semantic tags and clickable icons.

### 2. Coldplay Fan Page
A fun and informal band concert page with images, album highlights, marquee effects, and links. Practiced using lists, anchors, and multimedia tags.
